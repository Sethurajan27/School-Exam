  <h1>The Clever Rabbit</h1>

  <p>
    Once upon a time, in a jungle, there was a cruel lion who used to kill many animals. The animals were very scared and held a meeting. They decided to send one animal each day to the lion as his food, so he would not hunt more.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day, it was the turn of a clever rabbit. He reached the lion very late. The angry lion asked why he was so late. The rabbit cleverly said that another lion in the forest claimed to be the real king. The lion was furious and asked to be taken to that lion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rabbit led him to a deep well and showed the lion his reflection in the water. The lion thought it was another lion and jumped into the well to attack. He drowned and the jungle was safe again.
  </p>

    <strong>Example:</strong><br />
    The rabbit used his intelligence to save all the animals. This shows how cleverness can solve big problems.
