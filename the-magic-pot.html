  <h1>The Magic Pot</h1>

  <p>
    Once upon a time, a poor farmer found a pot buried in his field. To his surprise, whatever he put inside the pot doubled! He put a coin inside, and it became two coins. He put a grain sack, and it became two sacks!
  </p>
  <p>
    The farmer was very happy. He used the pot wisely to improve his life, buy seeds, and help his neighbors. But one day, his greedy neighbor came to know about it. Without permission, the neighbor jumped into the pot to take it away.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the magic pot doubled everything. Now there were two greedy neighbors fighting each other! The pot taught everyone a lesson — use gifts wisely and never be greedy.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Example:</strong><br />
    Like the wise farmer, if we use what we have with honesty and share with others, happiness grows.
